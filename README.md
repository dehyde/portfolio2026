# Portfolio 2026 (static build)

This repository now contains only the GitHub Pages output. Everything served on https://dehyde.github.io/portfolio2026/ lives in `docs/`; the original build tooling and source have been removed.

## What is here
- `docs/index.html` and `docs/subpage/index.html` use the bundled assets in `docs/assets/`.
- Assets reference the `/portfolio2026/` base path used by GitHub Pages.
- Root `index.html` simply points visitors to `docs/index.html`.

## How to preview
Open `docs/index.html` directly in your browser (or serve `docs/` from a local HTTP server). No build or install steps are required.
